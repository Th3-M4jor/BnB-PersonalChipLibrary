# BnB-PersonalChipLibrary
A not so simple C#-WPF GUI to handle storing all the BattleChips you have acquired in a game of Busters and BattleChips.

It also has support for managing some parts of your Operator and Navi's stats.
Support for the remainder will be added as the Table-Top-RPG's ruleset gets finalized.
